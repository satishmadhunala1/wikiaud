1991–2006: Debut and initial career
Rama Rao made his debut in the film Brahmarshi Vishwamitra (1991) as a child artiste at the age of seven. Written and directed by his grandfather N. T. Rama Rao, he played the role of Bharata. After a long gap, he then played the title role of Rama in the Gunasekhar-directed mythological film Ramayanam (1997), which won the National Film Award for Best Children's Film.[14] His performance in the film received critical appreciation.

K. Raghavendra Rao recommended Rama Rao to S. S. Rajamouli for his directorial debut, Student No. 1 (2001), during mid-2000 after being impressed with his performance in the auditions and his previous film, Ramayanam (1997). However, the film went under production for too long. He was later signed by producer Ramoji Rao, and decided to work on the romantic drama Ninnu Choodalani which marked his debut as a lead actor. By that time, he was only 17.[8] Student No. 1, which released later, went onto be successful while Subbu (2001) was a commercial failure.[15]
